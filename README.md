A simple phone number validator app.
I tried to create a simple ORM to make it easier querying tables. I also added a simple routing and templating systems.
No packages used in this project. I added the composer to autoload the classes files.

- Design patterns I tried to follow:
1- MVC architectural desgin pattern.
2- Factory pattern.
3- Builder pattern.
4- Dependency injection.
5- Facade design pattern.

The project is available on a private repository on Github. If you want an access mail me with your Github account username to kareemmorsy30@gmail.com.

Thanks for you time.
